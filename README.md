# Master's Thesis Proposal
The current project contains the [**Master's Thesis Proposal**](https://github.com/jriveraespejo/thesis_proposal/blob/master/Thesis_proposal_(preliminar).pdf) presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of **_Master of Science in Statistics and Data Science: for the Social, Behavioral and Educational Sciences_**, for the period 2019-2021, at [KU Leuven](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/2020/opleidingen/e/SC_51016989.htm#bl=02,0201,020101,020102,020103,02010301,02010302,0202,020202,020203,02020301).

## Title

**Hierarchical latent variable models:** 
**_Method, extensions, advantages, and educational policy implications_**

## General information

The short and long term benefits of effective teaching practices can be found in abundance throughout the academic literature. However, while this supports the perception that teachers are one of the main drivers behind the student achievements, the evidence backing such claims has suffered from two main problems: (i) they used proxy variables, which more often than not, were not consistently related to the quality of instruction, and (ii) they used methods that were not concerned in outlining the teaching factors responsible for the student's learning. Nevertheless, while the literature still reflects considerable uncertainty on what are the "ingredients for a good teacher", a good amount of evidence has supported the disciplinary and pedagogical knowledge as relevant components of the teacher effectiveness. Furthermore, the literature has also shown that valid and reliable standardized tests are among the best tools to assess such factors. 

In that sense, this proposal is set to research how to fill three main literature gaps. First, appraise if hierarchical latent variable models can provide a general framework to analyze educational data. Here the focus will be in finding if such framework could serve multiple psychometric purposes, and what are their advantages or disadvantages. Second, through the method, obtain a depiction of the disciplinary abilities of the teachers. And lastly, tests the policy implications of the methods, and its results, in a data composed of repeated large standardized educational assessments from Peru.
